# nginx-ip-blacklisting
My very first Bash script training.
Use it to block suspecious IP addresses by iptables.
The script gets an nginx log file as input; Also user must specify the number of limitation that an IP can request in one minute.
It will not check wether the file is valid or not. I've just put an nginx_logs_sample. Pls check that out.
I'll be so happy if anyone contribute to this student-level script.
